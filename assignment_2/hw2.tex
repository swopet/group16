\section{Questions}
\subsection{1. What do you think the main point of the assignment is?}
The main point of this assignment is probably to get us thinking about how the kernel handles requests for I/O of data from the disk, and understand the benefits of different schedulers. It was also a good introduction to kernel programming and understanding how to implement a patch to Linux.

\subsection{2. How did you personally approach the problem? Design decisions, algorithms, etc.}
After writing down pseudocode for both LOOK and C-LOOK, we decided to use C-LOOK; doing C-LOOK as opposed to LOOK allowed us to move the disk head only in one direction, simplifying the implementation somewhat.

\subsection{3. How did you ensure your soltuion was correct? Testing details, for instance.}

\subsection{4. What did you learn?}

\subsection{5. How should the TA evaluate your work? Provide detailed steps to prove correctness.}
